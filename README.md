# Analytics_Vidya_competion
This repository contains the notebooks which are submitted to the hackathon competitions conducted in the analytics vidya website.
## 1. Banking Competition 
Problem statement: To predict the interest rate of the customers based on the client information. 
## USES:
On one hand, knowing the factors will help consumers and borrowers to increase their credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate for getting a lower interest rate
## APPROACH 
1. Data Preparation
  1. Handled missing values
  2. Data visualization
  3. Outliers are handled
2. Model training 
   1. Random forest - Accuracy for random forest was checked but it was less since it is a competition accuracy matters and many categorical variables are there 
   2. Catboost is choosed

## 2. Janata Hack Computer Vision Competition

Problem statement : classifying vehicle images as either belonging to the emergency vehicle or non-emergency vehicle category. 
## USES:
Fatalities due to traffic delays of emergency vehicles such as ambulance & fire brigade is a huge problem. In daily life, we often see that emergency vehicles face difficulty in passing through traffic. So differentiating a vehicle into an emergency and non emergency category can be an important component in traffic monitoring as well as self drive car systems as reaching on time to their destination is critical for these services.
### APPROACH
Using transfer learning VGG-16 model was used to perform classification
